# To-do
The To-Do App is a client-side web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks with a user-friendly interface and persistent data storage through the browser’s Local Storage.
Users can add, edit, delete, mark/unmark, and search tasks. Each task contains an ID, Name, Description, Date, Time, and an optional Photo URL. Input validation ensures the integrity of task data, and the total task count, as well as marked/unmarked tasks, are displayed in real-time.

This app is ideal for learning or demonstrating CRUD operations, data binding, validation, local storage use, and beginner-level front-end architecture.
